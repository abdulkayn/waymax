At any moment during delivering message to a Participant the message can have zero or more of following delivery statuses: Message considered as sent to a participant, if the nearest upstream carrier accepted the message. Message considered as delivered to a participant, if Twilio has received confirmation of message delivery from the upstream carrier, and, where available, the destination handset. Message considered as undelivered to a participant, if Twilio has received a delivery receipt indicating that the message was not delivered. This can happen for many reasons including carrier content filtering and the availability of the destination handset. Message considered as read by a participant, if the message has been delivered and opened by the recipient in the conversation. The recipient must have enabled read receipts. Message considered as failed to be delivered to a participant if the message could not be sent.

Rejects if the User is not a Participant of the Conversation. Use this method to obtain the number of unread messages together with updateLastReadMessageIndex() instead of relying on the Message indices which may have gaps. See Message.index for details. This method is semi-realtime. This means that this data will be eventually correct, but will also possibly be incorrect for a few seconds.
